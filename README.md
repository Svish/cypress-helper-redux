# cypress-helper-redux

[![npm version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/cypress-helper-redux.svg?style=flat-square)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cypress-helper-redux)

> [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) [commands](https://docs.cypress.io/api/cypress-api/custom-commands.html) for manipulating a [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) store during testing. For example to:
>
> - Set up a predictable state before certain tests
> - Dispatch actions to make state adjustmens during tests
> - Validate state during or after tests have run

## Inspiration

- [Cypress Best Practices](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/best-practices.html#Organizing-Tests-Logging-In-Controlling-State)
- [This presentation at YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XQOK0v_YRE&t=1568)

## Setup

> _**Note:** For a complete example on hooking things up, with types and everything, have a look at the [sample app](app)._

### 1. Install dependency

```shell
npm install --save-dev cypress-helper-redux
```

### 2. Include the custom commands

```js
// In e.g. cypress/support/index.ts
include 'cypress-helper-redux';
```

### 3. Connect the helper with your store

```ts
// E.g. in src/store/index.ts

// Get initial state (for using cy.reduxVisit)
const initialState =
  'Cypress' in window ? (window as any).__chr__initialState__ : undefined;

// Create the store, as you normally would
const store = createStore(rootReducer, initialState);
export default store;

// Connect with the Cypress helper
if ('Cypress' in window) {
  const w = window as any;
  w.__chr__reduxStore__ = store;

  // The following is optional
  // See the sample app for an example of how this can be setup and used
  w.__chr__actionCreators__ = actionCreators;
  w.__chr__selectors__ = selectors;
}
```

### 4. If you're using Typescript...

Unfortunately I've not found a simple way to both extend the Cypress chain automatically _**and** allow you to specify/override the type of e.g. your Redux state_. So, the only stable solution I've currently found, is to just manually declare those types in your project. A little bit of a hassle, but luckily mostly copy-paste. And it also means typechecking and auto-complete should work great in your tests, which I quite important.

These are the types used by the API that you need to set to something. If you don't care, or don't use some of them, you can of course use `any` or `undefined` as well.

- `MyStore` ‚Äì The type of your Redux store, i.e. the type of what `createStore` returns.
- `MyRootState` ‚Äì The shape of your root state.
- `MyRootAction` ‚Äì The type of an allowed action, i.e. `AnyAction` or a composite type of the defined actions in your application
- `MyActionCreators` ‚Äì The type of your action creator object (or set to `undefined` if you don't use it)
- `MySelectors` ‚Äì The type of your selectors object (or set to `undefined` if you don't use it)

Create a new file, e.g. `cypress/support/cypress-helper-redux.d.ts`, paste in the following, and adjust if needed:

```ts
import {
  Store as MyStore,
  RootState as MyRootState,
  RootAction as MyRootAction,
  ActionCreators as MyActionCreators,
  Selectors as MySelectors,
} from '../../src/store';

// NOTE: Leave the following untouched

// Define cy.redux
interface ReduxResponse {
  store: MyStore;
  actions: MyActionCreators;
  selectors: MySelectors;
}
type Redux = () => Promise<ReduxResponse>;

// Define cy.reduxVisit
type ReduxVisitOptions = { initialState: Partial<MyRootState> } & Partial<
  Cypress.VisitOptions
>;
type ReduxVisit = (
  url: string,
  options: ReduxVisitOptions
) => Cypress.Chainable<Window>;

// Define cy.reduxDispatch
type ReduxDispatchCallback = (
  actions: MyActionCreators
) => MyRootAction | MyRootAction[];
type ReduxDispatchParameter =
  | MyRootAction
  | MyRootAction[]
  | ReduxDispatchCallback;
type ReduxDispatch = (
  ...actionsOrCallback: ReduxDispatchParameter[]
) => Promise<void>;

// Define cy.reduxSelect
type ReduxSelectSelector<T> = (state: MyRootState) => T;
type ReduxSelect = <T>(selector: ReduxSelectSelector<T>) => Promise<T>;

// Define cy.reduxSelector
type ReduxSelectPickSelector<T> = (
  selectors: MySelectors
) => ReduxSelectSelector<T>;
type ReduxSelector = <T>(
  pickSelector: ReduxSelectPickSelector<T>
) => Promise<T>;

// Add them all to the Cypress chain
declare global {
  namespace Cypress {
    interface Chainable<Subject> {
      redux: Redux;
      reduxVisit: ReduxVisit;
      reduxDispatch: ReduxDispatch;
      reduxSelect: ReduxSelect;
      reduxSelector: ReduxSelector;
    }
  }
}
```

> _**Please**, do let me know if you have any ideas of how to make this smoother. I'd really like it if a user only had to define those 5 dependent types, and the rest of the typings could be provided automatically by the package, but can't figure out how to do that. Seems I need generics on a module level, which does not exist, as far as I know..._ üòï

## Usage

### `cy.reduxVisit`

A wrapper around [`cy.visit`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/visit.html#Syntax) which allows you to specify the initial Redux state you want for a test:

```ts
cy.reduxVisit('/', {
  initialState: { ... },
});
```

Other options you supply will be sent through to `cy.visit`:

```ts
cy.reduxVisit('/', {
  initialState: { ... },
  method: 'GET',
  onBeforeLoad: (window) => console.log(window),
});
```

If you don't want or need to specify any initial state, you can of course also just use `cy.visit` as you normally would.

### `cy.redux`

Gives direct access to the Redux store to do with as you please.

```ts
cy.redux().then(({ store }) => {
  store.dispatch({
    type: 'set-value',
    payload: 'something',
  });

  const value = store.getState().foo.value;
  expect(value).to.equal('something');
});
```

If you hooked up the action creators and selectors, they're passed in as the next arguments:

```ts
cy.redux().then(({ store, actions, selectors }) => {
  store.dispatch(actions.foo.setSomething('something'));
  const value = selectors.foo.getSomething(store.getState());
});
```

### `cy.reduxSelect`

Wrapper around `cy.redux` for selecting a value from the current state, for example to validate something after or during a test.

```ts
// Using a function
cy.reduxSelect(state => state.foo.value).then(value => {
  expect(value).to.equal('something');
});

// Using an already defined selector function
cy.reduxSelect(getValue).then(value => {
  expect(value).to.equal('something');
});
```

### `cy.reduxSelector`

Wrapper around `cy.reduxSelect` which, if you've provided it, gives you access to the selectors object so you can pick your selector from that.

```ts
cy.reduxSelector(selectors => selectors.foo.getValue).then(value => {
  expect(value).to.equal('something');
});
```

### `cy.reduxDispatch`

Wrapper around `cy.redux` for dispatching actions, for example to set something up before or during a test.

```ts
// Single action
cy.reduxDispatch({ type: 'my-action' });

// Multiple actions, as parameters
cy.reduxDispatch(
  { type: 'my-action' },
  { type: 'my-other-action' },
  { type: 'my-third-action' }
);

// Multiple actions, as array
cy.reduxDispatch([
  { type: 'my-action' },
  { type: 'my-other-action' },
  { type: 'my-third-action' },
]);
```

You can also provide a callback for creating the actions:

```ts
// Callback returning a single action
cy.reduxDispatch(() => ({ type: 'my-action' }));

// Callback returning an array of actions
cy.reduxDispatch(() => [
  { type: 'my-action' },
  { type: 'my-other-action' },
  { type: 'my-third-action' },
]);
```

And if you've hooked up the action creators object, it's passed in as the first argument:

```ts
// Callback returning a single action, using the action creators object
cy.reduxDispatch(actions => actions.foo.myAction());

// Callback returning multiple action, using the action creators object
cy.reduxDispatch(actions => [
  actions.foo.myAction(),
  actions.foo.myOtherAction(),
  actions.foo.myThirdAction(),
]);
```

# TODO

1. **Typesafe Cypress commands, without copy-pasting stuff**  
   Really not sure how though... üòï

2. **Snapshot logging**  
   In Cypress there seems to be a way to do snapshot logging, which would be perfect to do before and after having dispatched any actions. However, I haven't yet been able to figure out exactly how one does that... please let me know if you have any pointers... ü§î

3. **Helper functions to connect store with helper**  
   Should be simple in theory, but for some reason, everything seems to crash (getting `cy is not defined` in Cypress) the _instant_ I do _any_ import of helper code from the application code... Might be simple enough as it is though, and it might prevent any helper code ending up in application bundles, so... maybe better the way it is...? Advice and feedback welcome... üëç
